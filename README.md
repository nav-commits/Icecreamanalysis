# Ice Cream Sales Prediction Model

## Overview
This project aims to predict ice cream sales numbers based on temperature using a supervised learning regression model. The analysis is conducted in a Jupyter Notebook titled "IceCreamAnalysis".

## Dataset
The dataset is in a CSV format containing historical data on temperature and corresponding ice cream sales.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas (for data manipulation)
- NumPy (for numerical computations)
- Matplotlib/Seaborn (for data visualization)
- scikit-learn (for machine learning model creation)

## Installation
Ensure that you have Python 3.x installed on your system. You can then install the required libraries using the following command:

## Usage
1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**
   - Load the dataset using Pandas.
   - Perform any necessary preprocessing steps like handling missing values, data normalization, etc.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Use Matplotlib/Seaborn for visualizing the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales.
   - Generate summary statistics to understand data distribution.

3. **Feature Selection**
   - Determine the features to be used for the regression model. In this case, it would mainly be the temperature.

4. **Model Building**
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Choose a regression model appropriate for the problem (e.g., Linear Regression).
   - Train the model on the training data.

5. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the model on the test set using appropriate metrics, such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) or R-squared.

6. **Model Prediction**
   - Use the trained model to make predictions on new data.

7. **Saving the Model (Optional)**
   - Save the trained model using joblib or pickle for later use.

## Running the Notebook
Launch Jupyter Notebook in your project directory:
Navigate to the "IceCreamAnalysis.ipynb" file and open it to run the cells.
